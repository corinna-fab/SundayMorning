# Sunday Morning

*Easy like Sunday Morning*

Sunday Morning is a vendor agnostic book tracking platform which puts the power in the hands of the reader. Unlike retailers who operate on a bottomline, libraries
who operate within the scope of their catalog, and archives/rare books whose material is often out of reach - Sunday Morning is focused on creating a smoother reading
experience by creating a single source of information that can be customized through categories and lists to make for easier hunting for the next read.
